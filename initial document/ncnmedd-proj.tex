\section*{Background}


The United States is a large and highly diverse country.  While the US is 
well-known for its general affection for laissez-faire economics, federal, 
state, and local governments play active economic roles.  Many of the federal 
government's economics-oriented agencies may be familiar to you.  The 
\href{https://sec.gov/}{Securities and Exchange Commission} regulates 
securities markets.   
The \href{https://fda.gov/}{Food and Drug Administration} oversees the safety 
and quality of food and 
drugs.  

The \href{https://eda.gov/}{Economic Development Administration} (EDA) may be a 
federal agency that is 
new to you.  EDA implements federal laws and policies designed to generate new 
employment, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial 
growth.   EDA  provides grants and technical assistance to local communities to 
create new employment, maintain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and 
commercial growth.  It provides direct financial investments through federal 
grants and loans.   EDA offers financial and technical aid to communities in 
economic distress from social and economic conditions, natural disasters, 
climate change, or other adverse conditions.

Economic Development Districts (EDDs) are local means by which EDA implements 
its diverse programs.  Economic Development Districts (EDDs) are locally 
defined organizations.  Once defined, a local organization applies to EDA for 
approval as an EDD.    They are often composed of multiple counties in a single 
state.  But there is a wide variety of EDDs.  Some cross state boundaries.   
What all EDDs share in common is a locally-based, regionally driven economic 
development planning process.  EDDs foster regional collaboration by working 
with the public, private and non-profit sectors of the economy. 

This semester we are working with the North Central New Mexico Economic 
Development District (NCNMEDD).  Our primary contacts at NCNMEDD are Alison 
Turner,  a Community Development Planner at NCNMEDD and recent MSSP graduate, 
and Aidan O'Hara, who has been preparing for this project since late July.


\section*{NCNMEDD}


The \href{https://www.ncnmedd.com/}{textNorth Central New Mexico Economic 
Development District} (NCNMEDD) is the 
regional Council of Governments for local governments in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, 
Taos, Colfax, Mora, San Miguel, Los Alamos, and Sandoval counties. 
Established 
in 1967, NCNMEDD assists local governments with community and economic 
development projects and initiatives.  Of particular importance, NCNMEDD is the 
conduit for EDA funding.  NCNMEDD also manages the Northern Pueblos and North 
East Regional Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs). 



A significant portion of the NCNMEDD's effort goes into supporting grant and 
loan application preparation by organizations in the region, including county 
and municipal governments, Native American 
 tribal and pueblo governments.

Grant applications focus primarily on community development block grants 
offered by the Economic Development Administration (EDA), the Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
Eligibility for grant funding is  calculated based on per capita income, 
unemployment, and labor market 
 information.  
 
 
\section*{Objective}

 
 In these efforts, the availability of relevant data is essential.  While data 
 are available from a broad array of sources, data access has been a 
 long-standing problem.   NCNMEDD clients report that in some cases, the 
 decision to pursue or not pursue a grant opportunity is driven by the 
 availability of data and staff to organize, analyze, and present data.  These 
 are the resource that will be used to establish grant eligibility and to 
 provide data-driven descriptions of the local conditions grant funding will 
 address.
 
 
 Since March 2020, Alison, Haviland and Allen Razdow have been working with 
 Allen Razdow to investigate using his \href{https://truenum.com/}{Truenumbers} 
 systme to streamline the data acquisition, organization, and analysis process.
 This project will continue this work with the goal of implementing a 
 Truenumbers-based support system for NCNMEDD.
